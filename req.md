# Zephyr - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

**Project Name:** Zephyr

**Product Type:** Python Package Manager and Virtual Environment Manager

**Target Audience:** Python developers, DevOps engineers, CI/CD pipelines

**Development Platform:** Cursor AI with Go implementation

**Timeline:** 6 months MVP, 12 months full release

Zephyr is a blazingly fast Python package manager and virtual environment manager built in Go, designed to replace or complement existing tools like pip, poetry, and conda. Taking inspiration from Rust's uv, Zephyr aims to deliver 10-100x performance improvements while maintaining full compatibility with Python packaging standards.

# Project management
zephyr init                    # Create pyproject.toml
zephyr sync                    # Install from lockfile
zephyr lock                    # Generate lockfile

```

### Configuration

- Global configuration file (`~/.zephyr/config.toml`)
- Project-level configuration (`pyproject.toml` integration)
- Environment variable overrides
- Custom index URLs and authentication

### Error Handling

- Clear, actionable error messages
